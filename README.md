# C-projects
Here you will find the C code files that I wrote while learning the language.
The structure is as follows: each folder contains two code files and two assignment files

Each code file corresponds to a task description file that is located directly below it

For example:

12

----lab12.c

----laboratornaia-rabota-12.pdf

----sam12.c

----samostoiatelnaia-rabota-12.pdf
